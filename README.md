## Onshape Design
### Goal 
The goal of our onshape design was to create a box that would hold a metro, battery pack, lcd, photinterupter, potentiometer, led and switch. Our inspiration was an old record player so we mounted the wheel on the top of a short box. We first made a box and use the friction fit tool to get the correct amount of offset. We then added out parts into an assembley and by editing in context created the holes and mounts for the battery, led, switch, photointerupter, potentiometer, LCD, and motor.

### Reflection
The design of the box was very easy because we both had extensive experience with onshape and were good at it. We finished the main design of the box multiple days ahead of schedule. The one oversight we had with our design was not making the wheel solid with cut out holes. Initially we added teeth to the outside of the wheel to interupt the photointerupter. This was unfortunate because we did not realize our mistake until after we tested the wheel and saw that it kept cliping the photointerupter. A more thorough review of possible issues with our design would have fixed this problem. It also teaches us the importance of prototypes. If we had considered multiple wheel design at first we would have had alternate solutions that might have been better. Other than that the onshape design went very well. The box was the perfect size and looked very good. 



## Code and Wiring
### Goal
**Code:** The code is written to first use a potentiometer to control the speed of a dc motor. Then a photointerupter tracks when the each hole in the wheel passes by looking if the state changes. When the state changes the time function is called and logged as time1. When the state changes again a second time is logged and the two are subtracted giving us deltatime. Then using a simple conversion we can calculate RPM. A list was added for fun to add some creativity to the project. Each time an RPM value is calculated it is added to the list. The sum of the list is taken and divided by the length of the list. This calculates average RPM.

### Reflection
| Code Reflection written by Zach | Wiring Reflection written by Vincent |
| ------ | ------ |
| Writing the code was something I was not looking forward to for this project. Not that I would not be able to, but coding is not always the most interesting to me. Writing this code was far different. It was so much fun and it was the most I had ever learned about a coding language in one project. There were some parts that were rough, but I learned valuable lessons along the way. The first is the usefullness of writing out your program in pseudo code. This helped me organize my thoughts and keep the order of each part straight. Next, I learned how important it is to check your indentations. This code has several embedded if statements and initially, I had things in embedded in if statements that changed the variable to allow me to enter that if statement. This made it impossible to enter the statement and my code was rendered useless. Finally, I learned several minor things, like how code libraries work when implementing the PID and list, and append for calculating average RPM. In conclusion, although we did not have time to fully tweak the PID values the code of this project was very enjoyable and taught me so much. |The wiring wasnâ€™t too hard, just tedious. To wire everything I just combined all of the wirings from my previous projects. I learned a lot too, like how to wire on a mini breadboard. I also learned that you can use a switch to turn off the ground from multiple batteries, which creates one switch that can turn off multiple separate batteries. The hardest part was keeping things orderly but I got it done. |

## Construction

We had some issues in the construction of our contraption. The first issue we had is that the divider for our box had tabs that didn't fit so we had to sand down the tabs. Our biggest issue was that our wheel spun with a wobble. We attempted to fix this many times with 3d printing parts and using hotglue. our final solution was a laser cut washer we glued to the wheel to keep it level. we made some other mistakes like designing the wheel with spokes that hit the photointeruptor. we fixed this problem by cutting a wheel with a smooth perimeter. We also made the wheel clear which wouldn't have worked with the photointeruptor. we fixed that by making the wheel black.

## Reflection

Overall this project wasn't too hard and we learned a lot. designing our box and wheel on onshape was by far the easiest part. We made some mistakes with the design of the wheel and some of the fittings on the box but we fixed them. assembling the box was also pretty easy with the exception of our wheel which took many attempts to fix its wobble and other issues. Coding was probably the most difficult part of this project but zach learned alot and wrote code that works. even though we didn't have enough time to tweak the values of our PID we think it was a sucess. In the end we built a motor whose speed was controlled using a potentiometer.
